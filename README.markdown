SharePoint 2007 Template Layout
====================

This template is offered as a way to create professional applications that resemble the SharePoint 2007 layout, with a few minor tweaks and additions, to add to the overall user experience.

How To Use
====================

Simply edit the given sample files to suit your needs. There are no special configuration settings. This template is vanilla PHP sliced up with normal HTML, css, and javascript (jQuery). Inspired by an MVC (minus the controllers for demo purposes) approach, therefore the directory structure should be familiar to those who have used this design pattern.

There is one thing of note, the $path variable is a global variable that should set the path of the current file relative to the root directory of the application. See the modules\samples\ directory for an illustration.

Known Issues
====================

This template is a stripped down version of what I have been using for some time, therefore the CSS and images directory might contain content that is not actually being referenced by this layout.

Copyright and Ownership
====================
The SharePoint name and any images used are copyright to their original authors.
